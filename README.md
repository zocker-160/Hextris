Hi there,
this is Java Hextris.
You need a working java compiler and runtime environment installed which 
support at least java version 1.5. Currently it has only been tested with the 
Sun JDK on Linux and Windows. There is an ant-build-script build.xml that can 
be used to compile Java Hextris. So if you have installed ant you can type 
ant compile 
in this directory to compile Java Hextris,
ant build 
to build a jar file and
ant run
to run Java Hextris. Later option will build a jar file first.

Current releases and documentation can be found at the Java Hextris homepage

Have fun
